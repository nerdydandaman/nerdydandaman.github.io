This page hosts the files and scripts for my undergraduate research project, in which I designed a browser-based educational simulation to teach about inertial reference frames.
I have included the .jpg images, index files, CSS code files, and SVG images that allow the simuation to run off of GITHUB's servers. 
The simulation can be used on its own, but it is meant to be used by students along with an included student worksheet. Also included is a teacher's guide to help instructors plan lessons using this activity.
